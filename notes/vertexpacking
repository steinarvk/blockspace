point sprites
or quads (possibly better -- less limitations, even though storage space x4)
    (quads just have different offsets -- otherwise the same.)

for bullets we can save on effects by putting the velocity in the data.
this should be helpful for bulletspam situations, especially for the
bullets from rapid-fire weapons
(although we still have to do the calculations for collisions)

    (design 1: COM and rotate around that)
uniforms:
    float[2]: world coordinates translation
    float[2]: screen size (for aspect ratio)

attributes:
    float[2]: world coordinates of center of mass
    float: angle (rotation around center of mass, and sprite display angle)
    float[2]: world coordinates offset from center of mass, unrotated
    float[2]: texture coordinates position
    float: texture coordinates size
    float[4]: rgba tint
