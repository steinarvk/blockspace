(For later when a game is clearly established)

The shooting-off parts brings to mind mechanics of ransom and surrender for
ships with "pilots". A ship can easily be shot helpless and should then be
able to surrender, e.g. pay some ransom in exchange for being left alone.
One can decline the ransom, but this gives you a reputation for being a
murderer. Similarly you can pay off people to stop fighting before the
fight even begins, and you can simply trade with ships you meet.

Communication would be by choosing a response with the number keys.
