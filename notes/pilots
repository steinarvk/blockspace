The shooting-off parts brings to mind mechanics of ransom and surrender for
ships with "pilots". A ship can easily be shot helpless and should then be
able to surrender, e.g. pay some ransom in exchange for being left alone.
One can decline the ransom, but this gives you a reputation for being a
murderer. Similarly you can pay off people to stop fighting before the
fight even begins, and you can simply trade with ships you meet.

Communication would be by choosing a response with the number keys.

Pilots have factions, and you can build up a reputation with them
(possibly even join them).


Natural radio messages:
    - Hello, I've arrived
    - Hello, newcomer [when you arrive after them]
    - Want to trade?
    - I will be attacking you now because [...]
    - Requesting emergency assistance [e.g. sell me an engine block/fuel]
    - I surrender and will pay you X to stop fighting
    - I'll pay you to do [quest -- e.g. killing another pilot]
