In a 360 game, you have a spaceship made of blocks.
(hexagons might be the simples shape that can pull this off well _alone_)
(note that combining shapes would be very fun: e.g. squares + triangles + hexagons
 but this is complicated for first release)
(lengths must match exactly to combine. components cannot overlap)

Blocks can have material, a module, AND something attached on the outsides.
Blocks can have weapons, power, and engines.

Weapons: Directional, must point outwards. Fire a projectile. Require power to fire.
    Pellet [low cooldown, low damage, dumb]
    Missile [high cooldown, medium damage, homing]
    Mine [medium cooldown, high damage, dumb proximity]
Armour: No functionality. Simply very hard to destroy ('damage reduction' and high HP)
Connector: No functionality. Very light.
Engines: Increase mobility. Constant power draw. Directional, must point outwards, power doubled when going in the right direction.
Repair: Provides gradual self-repair. Power draw when damaged.
Generator: Recharge power.
Shield: Provides "virtual blocks" 2 blocks ahead that block OTHER people's shots with probability equal to health. Power draw to recharge shields.
Cockpit: The "heart". Blocks severed from this are detached.
        

Levels 1-9 for each module with numeric differences (higher is better and rarer)

Too many blocks increase your mass and slow you down.

Blocks that are detached from a ship (yours or enemy) but not destroyed float around
and can be collected.
